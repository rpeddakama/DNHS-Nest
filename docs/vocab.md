|[De Morgan's Law]() |De Morgan's Laws realte to the and (&&) and or operators in Java. It states that !(x && y) is the same as !x || !y. Also, !(x || y) = !x && !y which makes a lot of sense and shows how the statements are equivalent. | |
|[Comparing Numbers]() | Two numbers can be compared by using double equals and doing Object1 == Object2; true is returned if ture and otherwise, false. | |
| [Comparing Strings]() | Two Strings can be compared by doing Object1.equals(Object2); true is returned if ture and otherwise, false.  |  | 
| [Comparing Objects]() | Two objects can be compared by doing Object1.equals(Object2); true is returned if ture and otherwise, false.  |  | 
| [for loop, enhanced for loop]() | A for loop is an iterative tool that goes through a variable or collection of data; using the iterative variable i, for each value of i until the limit is reached (generally set to the length), certain code will run. An enhanced for loop is similar in ways but it occurs for each variable in a set; for instance, for each character in a String or each String in an array. |  | 
| [while loop versus do while loop]() |In Java, while loops check a certain condition and if it is true, the code inside will run. A do while loop runs the code first and then checks the condition to see if it is true; if it is, the code above will run again. Therefore, a do while loop always runs at least once, but a while loop does not.  |  | 
| [nested loops]() | Nested loops are when at least one loop is inside of another and they all run; for each time the outer loop runs, the inner completely runs for instance.|  | 
| [Big O notation (Hash map, Binary Search, Single loop, Nested Loop)]() |Big 0 notations are algorithms. Hash maps contain keys and values and they are tables that maps the keys and values; simmilar to an array, it is a collection of data essentially. Binary search is a search algorithm that can sort an algorithm and find a specific item from it. A single loop is just a regular loop that occurs and runs whereas for loops are where multiple loops inside of each other.  |  | 
| [Creating a Class, describe Naming Conventions]() | A class is created by using the word class or public class followed by the name. In Java, naming is typically done in camel case where after the first word, every first letter of the following words are capitalized. For class nams, the same applies, but the first word's first letter is also capitalized. |  | 
| [Constructor, describe why there is no return]() | A construcotr is a method called after an object is instantiated and sets parameters for the object of the class to be created. (initializes object) There is no return type because this runs during runtime and get called one time **internally** |  | 
| [Accessor methods, relationship to getter]() |Accesor methods allow one to get the values of instance variables outside a class; it is commonly known as a getter.  |  | 
| [Mutator methods, relationship to setter, describe void return type]()| Mutator methods are methods when variables in the class' values are changed, generally called setters. Void return types is where not value in specific is returend from the method; rather, in the method, print statements or other actions are carried out. |  | 
|[Static variables, Class variables]() | Static variables are used when the variables are not really used in any other methods and this memory happens only once. Whereas, class variables can be updated and sued well in methods. |  | 
| [Static methods, Class methods]() |Static methods are methods that can be called without an instance of a class being created while class methods require that instance.  |  | 
| [this Keyword]() |The this keyword is a reference to the current object being in a method and *not* a parameter if they have the same name.  |  | 
|[main method, tester methods]() |The main method is a tester method that is essentially used in order to to run the class and methods in it. Main method: public static void main(String[] args) {}  |  | 
| [Inheritance, extends]() | In Java, inheritance  is crucial to connect classes that are similar. The child class inherits methods and variables from this parent class. Extends is the keyword used ot make one class a subclass of another. |  | 
| [Subclass constructor, super Keyword]()| When a class is inherited, constructors from the super class are not inherited. As a result, teh super keyword is used in order to make them the same. |  | 
| [Overloading a method, same name different parameters]() | Method overloading is where there are multiople methods in a class by the same name but have different parameters. |  | 
| [Overriding a method, same signature of a method]()|verriding used to achieve polymorphism and when a subclass and super class have methods with the same name, override will override the method from the super class. | |
|[Abstract Class, Abstract Method]() | Abstract classes are classes that are inherited by other classes if they are related -- cannot create objects. Abstract methods are used in abstract classes/sub classes. |  | 
|[Object superclass methods: toString(), compare(), clone()]() |A toString() method is very simple that gives out a value as a String. compare() gives 0 if two variables are qual and 1  if the first one is less than the other. clone() duplicates variables and object references |  | 
|[Late binding of object, referencing superclass object, ie Animal a = new Chicken(); Animal b = new Goat();]() |Late binding explained below. A reference to a super class object is used in a sub class that inherits the super class (if they are related. Methods for it explained below  | |
| [Polymorphism: any of overloading, overriding, late binding]() | It is where inheritance is used to relate multiple classes. Method overloading is where there are multiople methods in a class by the same name but have different parameters. Overriding used to achieve polymorphism and when a subclass and super class have methods with the same name, override will override the method from the super class. Late binding is when binding occurs after runtime. | |
